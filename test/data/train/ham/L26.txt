Subject: Sitting Arrangments..................






Dear Students,
Greetings.


Please find attached a copy of sitting arrangement for the exams on Monday.


Check carefully and note that you must be seated at the place
allocated to you. Failure to that attract LOSS OF ALL exam marks.
Please note that.


If you have a group, and you do not have a place to sit in for this
exam, meet me urgently.




It has come to my notice that many people have abandoned the group
work without finishing the group submission. Already, 7 groups have
submitted with names of members missing. this means that those who
names are missing DID NOT do the group work and to miss the group work
is to fail the course! Please work as a group and submit your group
work.




Meanwhile, I will be in the office tomorrow, Saturday, from 12:30 pm
for anyone who want to sign his or her course forms.
I wish you all the very best.
Thanks
