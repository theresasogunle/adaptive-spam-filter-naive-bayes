Hi Kelly,


We're reaching out to let you know about upcoming changes to the Oculus Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. These changes give you more information about the services we provide and how we use data to create a great VR experience for you.


In the coming weeks, we'll introduce My Privacy Center, a new, centralized place to review and adjust your privacy and data controls. You’ll be able to review your settings, manage your communications preferences, and do things like download your data and delete your account.


The updated Privacy Policy includes details on how to use My Privacy Center, along with more detailed information about how we use data to create a customized and enjoyable VR experience. In the updated Terms of Service you'll find more detailed information about our Oculus services, how we provide those services, and the code of conduct we expect and will require Oculus users to follow.


You can learn more by reading the updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, which will apply to everyone with an Oculus account as of May 20, 2018. We hope you'll continue to use our services, but if you don't want these terms to apply to you, you may delete your account by contacting customer support.
