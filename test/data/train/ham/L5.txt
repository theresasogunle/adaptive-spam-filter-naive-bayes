Hi Gab,
A while back, you were searching for study options on Mastersportal. We wanted to ask you if you’ve started studying at the university that you’ve found on our portal.




The reason why we ask is to see if we properly supported you with your decision. By taking our 40 seconds survey (yes, we did actually time it!), we’ll be able to improve our work and help out more students from your country that are looking for their dream studies.
Thank you for your time!
Keep on rocking,
Your Studyportals Team
