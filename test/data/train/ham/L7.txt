Hi Mummy K.
 
See below from Grandma Kathy.
 
Please, do go throw and pick whatever you will like to donate.
 
Note Please, she does not want names written on anything as we had earlier planned.
 
 
This can be done even after Christmas in case you dont have the time now.
 
Many thanks for your support.
 
Cheers,
Trisha
