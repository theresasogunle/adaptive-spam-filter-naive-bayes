As a student, aspiring to reach the peak of my career as a director in the media industry, I hold the belief that to reach great heights, one needs to be committed, open to new ideas and ready to work hard. I am always thrilled to work with new people and to learn new ideas, which is why I have chosen to study and further develop my skills at the University of Hertfordshire.
 
I am applying to take the Film & Television course at the University of Hertfordshire because I am keenly interested in the modules covered there, particularly Creative Economies and Film and Television Production. I hope to benefit from this community and also give back in the best way possible. My interest in these modules was aroused during my second year of undergraduate study at the University of Bedfordshire whilst treating the unit course Working In Media where I assessed myself based on how much I had done to make myself industry worthy. This unit guided me in discerning for myself what skills are needed to gain entry to and further stand out in the media industry. I also learnt that the University of Hertfordshire has a very friendly environment for its students, which has been endorsed by conversations with students from your school. 
 
I have enjoyed the past three years of study in the United Kingdom because of its high educational standards in media studies and the vast opportunities given to international students to learn and engage with the society. I believe that if given another opportunity, I will be able to develop myself to reach an exceptional level in my career. I have not restricted myself to practical filmmaking. Over my three-year undergraduate study I completed a research project on 24, Ideologies, And Its Producer to analyse media theories through film, especially on the effects of producers' ideologies in film. 
 
Going through the modules for MA Film and Television, I was convinced that I could address the areas needed to improve my skills in filmmaking and discover a professional approach to begin my career. I have always aspired to improve the media culture of my home country Nigeria and having come here to study for my Bachelors degree, the culture I have been introduced to highlights the power of a strong media culture and its importance in projecting the status of the society to its audience. At the end of my study, I hope to have achieved the desired skills necessary to build a career as a freelance director and producer of film, in a country with a growing media industry.
