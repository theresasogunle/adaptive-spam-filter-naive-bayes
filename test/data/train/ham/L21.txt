Dear Family,
We are convinced that God is leading the Body of Christ worldwide but especially on the African Continent into uncharted territories. Age-old norms for how we “do church” and operate ministries are being challenged and ultimately phased out by Heaven. The Father is raising a new generation of Apostolic and Prophetic believers who will live out the famous line from the Lord’s Prayer; “Thy Kingdom, Thy Will be done, in earth as it is in HEAVEN. The primary marker of this move of God is the removal of the one between the pulpit and the pew. 


God is raising a COMMUNITY of Transformation Agents who each understand their purpose in the Kingdom and coalesce around leaders who empower rather than restrict potential. 
To find out how and where you fit in this plan, we excitedly invite you to our Quarterly School of Ministry & Leadership/Mentoring Day this coming Saturday (21st April 2018) at Kingdom Culture Movement, Lagos where we will be exploring the overarching theme: “Building Kingdom Communities”. Some of the issues we will be tackling include:


1. The Church and how it compares to the “Ekklesia” described in Matthew 16
2. The Role of the Church in Shaping Heaven’s Agenda for Society
3. The Church as a Cluster of Kingdom Communities
4. How to Build & Activate Effective Kingdom Communities
5. Levels of Kingdom Communities: Gatherings, Assemblies, Tribes & Houses
 
Ministering will be 
Israel (Olumide) Isiavwe, Kingdom Culture International Overseer
Deji Irawo, CEO, X2D & Kingdom Culture Nigeria Overseer
Worship by Viva, Raymond Okpara and Emeka Madubata
We look forward to seeing you there. Spread the word and its start a movement of Kingdom reformation in our generation.
Every Blessing
