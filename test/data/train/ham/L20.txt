The Good Survivalist


Imagine growing 6,000 pounds of fresh food on a tenth of an acre. 
Well, one family has done just that! In their tenth of an acre they 


are able to get 400 kinds of plants, 4,300 pounds of fresh veggies, 
900 chicken eggs, and 1000 duck eggs.


In addition to that they are also able to harvest 25 pounds 
of honey, plus various seasonal fruits. 


What more is they


report making $20,000 after they eat what they have grown, 
and produced.


Hopefully this will motivate some of you to get growing!
