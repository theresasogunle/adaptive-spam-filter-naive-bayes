It's The Season of Fish
Easter weekend is nearly here, which means breaking the Lenten fast for many. Fried rice and roast chicken may be on the menu on Sunday, but it’s tradition to eat fish on Good Friday. For those of you who aren’t quite sure why this is, we’ve got all the fish-related information.
Many Christians, especially Catholics, refrain from eating meat on Friday, and this tradition is most popular on Good Friday. Jesus was executed on Good Friday and on the anniversary of his death, the church encourages followers to abstain from eating the flesh of warm-blooded animals on this day. People are told to go for the alternative which is fish. As fish comes from the sea, they are cold-blooded, it is thought of as a different kind of flesh meaning it is okay for consumption on Good Friday. Now that you know all about fish and Good Friday, there's only one place to check for your fish...that's right, here!
