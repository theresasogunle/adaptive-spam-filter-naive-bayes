Why Always Me?
Why always me? Those must be the words of corn flakes every time shoppers reach for them in supermarkets - of all the many breakfast cereals on offer, why do you always pick me? Poor little corn flakes is right to think this because in any cereal aisle, there'll be a wide variety of packs of all shapes and sizes, so why restrict yourself to one? Why not try some oats, muesli, coco balls, weetabix, granola or even some pap. Give corn flakes a rest and try a new cereal today.
