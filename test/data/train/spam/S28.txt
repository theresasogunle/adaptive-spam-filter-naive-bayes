Subject: [52 Pickup] Your preview ends tomorrow






 %$firstname$%,
You reserved tickets a week in advance, paid for popcorn so expensive it must be sprinkled with gold dust and yet sometimes the previews at the beginning of the movie can turn out to be the best part of a movie that didn’t live up to expectation. It leaves you feeling like it was a waste of both your money and time and all you have to show for it is an artificial butter stain on your jeans.
However, your 7-day preview of the 52 Pickup Program is only a setup for greater things to come. 
Your full edition of the 52 Pickup Program will be delivered tomorrow and your credit card will be charged an additional $47.95, unless you email your cancellation to cancel@pickupyourstyle.com.
However, why would you want to cancel when you have only received 5 of the full 52 weeks, which comes out to only $0.94 a week – a small price to pay for you to finally be able to step into your style.
Trust me the “movie” is better than the preview and the 52 Pickup Program will not require you to learn how to get out butter stains.
 
Best,
