Have A Drink; You've Earned It
 
This weekend, forget all the usual stuff - running errands, cooking, taking care of the kids, attending weddings of people you hardly know, going to the hair salon...forget it all and just relax. Lagos living can be stressful and every now and again it makes sense to just stay home and take a break from all the hecticness. Your hibernation will be incomplete without a bottle of wine to help ease all the physical and mental wahala of your daily grind. We've got a selection of fine white wine for you to choose from; get a bottle today and enjoy a glass or two this weekend; you've earned it.
