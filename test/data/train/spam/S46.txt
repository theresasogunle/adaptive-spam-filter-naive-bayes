The side hustle that pays you daily.
You must have heard business coach says things like, "The key to wealth and happiness in today’s world is to create multiple streams of income using diverse business models and combinations of passive and active income in areas where your passions and talents can be most thoroughly engaged." and boast on how you must not depend on your main income either salary or proceeds from your business alone and get a second way to make money.


But what they always forget to mention is the factors to consider in choosing a side-hustle.
* Have you consider the time this second hustle will cost you?
* Have you consider the number of potential clients you will have?
* And how easy is it to manage?
Since it is a side-hustle, then the above questions must be positive and it must be able to sustain itself even if you are not around.


How about I introduce you to an SMS business that you can start with just N100,000 and make daily money as long as their are churches, businesses, associations, mosques, political parties and any gathering will like to get the word out via SMS.
