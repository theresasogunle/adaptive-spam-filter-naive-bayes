You must have heard of email marketing and how huge the ROI can be.
But truly, you're still struggling with a low open rate and conversions in your campaigns. The issue might not be the platform you're sending from, the major issue is always about the list you're sending to.
In the last campaign you ran, how many people viewed it, how many people click a link on it or replied you and the main question, how can people actually patronise you from that campaign?
You really need to get a new list and try out your products with them. You need to show some new set of people the amazing things you're offering in your business.
We recently cleaned one of our most converting email database. And it reduced from about 250,000 to 182,000 emails.
This new 182,000 emails is what we are giving you to improve your email marketing. It will go for just N20,000 today before the price moves up by next week.

Success in your business and have a lovely weekend ahead
